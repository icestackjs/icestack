# Contribute

## How to contribute

For example, if you want to contribute a component, you can write it in 'packages/ui/components' and build it

Add the corresponding documents in 'storybook' and 'website'

Of course, the contribution code is originally a very noble behavior. You can't force it. Thank you for your efforts.
