## Used from the Cli command line

## Initializing the configuration

First after installing `@icestack/ui` you can run.

```bash
npx icestack init
```

This command generates an `icestack.config.js` file in the current directory, which by default looks like this.

```js filename="icestack.config.js"
/**
 * @type {import('@icestack/ui').Config}
 */
const config = {
  outdir: './my-ui'
}

module.exports = config
```

## Build styles

You can configure your own styles and options in `config`, and when you're done, run.

```bash
npx icestack build
```

Or add this script to your `package.json`.

```diff filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
+   "build:ui": "icestack build"
  },
}

```

Then running `npm run build:ui` achieves the same result.

## The build product

After running the build command, if the build is successful, the `my-ui` directory in your current directory will have all the `css` and `js` files, which you can load and use as you see fit.

> It is recommended to put `my-ui` in your `.gitignore` to avoid committing too many files to `git`.

There are three main types of files in `my-ui`.

### css

The `css` folder is used for storing raw `css`, and contains a large number of `@apply` directives, which must be used in conjunction with `tailwindcss` in order to use the `css` output directly.

### css-resolved

The `css-resolved` folder is used to store `css` products that have been processed by `tailwindcss` and can be used without registering `tailwindcss`.

### js

The `js` folder is used to store the `js` forms of the styles in `css-resolved`, i.e. `CssInJs`, which can be used by `js` or loaded as `tailwindcss plugin` base data.
