# Core concepts

`@icestack/ui` was designed to be a very flexible `Css` component framework generator.

It provides us with a set of predefined scenarios by default that we can use right out of the box, but its magic goes far beyond that.

Around the idea of `CssInJs`, `@icestack/ui` has built a powerful set of style compilation capabilities.

This gives us the flexibility to generate the styles we want.

We can pass in parameters to: `@icestack/ui`.

- Generate a variety of themes, including but not limited to `Light`, `Dark`, `Tritanopia`, `Dimmed`, and so on.

- You can also add different theme colors to the controls, such as `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `btn-accent` to give them the theme color you want.

- You can also provide them with more sizes including but not limited to `xs`,`sm`,`md`,`lg`, like `xl`,`2xl`,`3xl`.

- More shapes than `square`, `circle`.

- and it's easy to extend and override existing styles.

## Component Styling

By default, a component consists of three styles, `base`, `styled`, and `utils`. The style priority between them is: `base`, `styled`, and `utils`.

`utils` > `styled` > `base`.

### base

As the name suggests, this is the base of the component, and usually has the lowest priority.

### styled

This is where you can store styled variants of the component, such as colors, default sizes, behaviors, etc.

### utils

This is where the component's sizes, shapes, and so on are stored, and is usually the highest priority.

## Component modes

There are three main component modes, `styled`, `base` and `raw`.

### styled

- In this mode all component styles are loaded, including `base`, `styled` and `utils`.

### base

- In this mode, only the `base` component styles are loaded.

### raw

- In this mode, nothing is loaded, and the generator becomes a canvas waiting to be painted, and you have full control over the generation of the components through the configuration items.

## CssInJs

For all uses, we can pass in objects that extend and override the behavior of the component.

The structure is similar to.

```js
{
  ".btn": {
    "&-block": {
      "apply": [
        "w-full",
      ],
      "css":{

      }
    },
    "&-circle": {
      "&:where(.btn-lg)": {
        "apply": [
          "h-16",
          "w-16",
          "rounded-full",
          "p-0",
        ],
        "css":{

        }
      },
    },
  },
}
```

A structural system such as this.

```ts
{
  ${selector}:{
    apply: string[]
    css: Record<string,string>
    ${childSelector}:{
      // ...
      // css
      // apply
      // child selector
    }
  }
}
```

This is the syntax we'll use to extend and override components, where the `css` object, which is the basic `CssInJs` object, generates the `CSS` code for the corresponding node.

The `apply` string array is passed to `tailwindcss`, which is then `resolved` to `CSS` and merged with the object in the `css` field.

> You can use the `transformCss2Js` method exported in `@icestack/ui/components` to quickly transform any `css` string into this format!

## Build

After executing the `build` command, `@icestack/ui` generates three types of files in the specified folder.

1. `css` This folder is used for storing raw `css`, and contains a large number of `@apply` directives, which must be used in conjunction with `tailwindcss` in order to use the `css` output.
2. `css-resolved` This folder holds `css` products that have been processed by `tailwindcss` and can be used by you.
3. `js` This folder holds the `js` output of `css-resolved` styles.
