# Default preset

Under the default default of `@icestack/ui`:

## Global color type

There are five main global default color types: `primary`, `success`, `warning`, `error`, `neutral`

So such classes are generated in the `css` products of each component:

```js
// btn
'btn-primary', 'btn-success', 'btn-warning', 'btn-error', 'btn-neutral'
// badge
'badge-primary', 'badge-success', 'badge-warning', 'badge-error', 'badge-neutral'
```

For this type of CSS product, the color is global and can be freely modified and expanded through configuration.

## Component size and shape

The same principle applies. There are four default sizes: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, and `lg`, so the following will be generated:

```js
// btn
'btn-xs', 'btn-sm', 'btn-md', 'btn-lg',
// badge
'badge-xs', 'badge-sm', 'badge-md', 'badge-lg'
```

For this type of CSS product, the component size is unique to each component and can be freely modified and expanded using `CSS Schema`.

In addition, the shape of the component also follows the component. Each component is different and can be freely modified and expanded.

## theme

By default, `light` and `dark` **2** modes are preset, which will generate their own `CSS` variable blocks. Of course, you can also override and extend them.

The default generated results are as follows:

```css
:root {
   --ice-primary: 22 119 255;
   --ice-primary-hover: 64 150 255;
   --ice-primary-active: 9 88 217;
   --ice-primary-content: 255 255 255;
   /* ... */
}

[data-mode='dark'] {
   --ice-primary: 22 104 220;
   --ice-primary-hover: 21 84 173;
   --ice-primary-active: 60 137 232;
   --ice-primary-content: 255 255 255;
   /* ... */
}
```

Of course, your newly added theme will also become such a `CSS` variable block for dynamic switching.
