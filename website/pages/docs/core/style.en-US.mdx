# Component style

## Component style

By default, a component consists of three parts of styles, namely `base`, `styled`, and `utils`. The priority of styles between them is:

`utils` > `styled` > `base`

### base

As the name suggests, this is the most basic style in the component, and usually has the lowest priority.

### styled

Some style variants of the component are saved here, such as color, default size, behavior, etc.

###utils

Some sizes, shapes, etc. of this component are saved here. Usually, this has the highest priority.
