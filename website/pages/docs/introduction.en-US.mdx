# @icestack/ui

A Free `CSS` Framework Paradigm Generator

## Preface

As you can intuitively tell from the name, this is another UI-related project.

Nowadays, UI frameworks have become so numerous that some of them are already very well established in the industry, like `mui`/`antd`/`element`/`vuetify`, that they are almost the first frameworks to be considered in `react`/`vue`.

So why write such a `@icestack/ui`? What's so special about it and what pain points does it solve?

## What is `@icestack/ui`?

`@icestack/ui` is not essentially a UI framework, it's essentially a `UI CSS paradigm` generator.

It is a `UI CSS paradigm` generator, which means that you can quickly generate your own `CSS paradigms`! Of course you can use the default set of `Paradigms` provided internally, or you can override or extend it.

> For example, using the defaults is like using a default instance of `axios`, and your own generated framework is an instance of `axios.create`.

You are free to manipulate the behavior of all `CSS` paradigms based on the configuration items, including but not limited to.

- Adding/subtracting/overriding/modifying theme colors to different components (e.g., buttons have `default`, `primary`, `success`, `warning`, `error` by default, and you add a `secondary`, `accent` color and declare them `hover/focus/active ` etc.)
- add/decrease/override/modify the size, shape, style of components (e.g. buttons are default `sm`,`md`,`lg` and you add `xs`,`xl`,`2xl` to the size)
- Add new `CSS` components to this system.

Also, the `CSS Paradigm` result generated by this generator is very less invasive, by default it doesn't carry any `css reset/normalize` styles, it just globally injects some calculated `CSS` variables.

The result is also very intuitive, and you can use it to customize the `UI` behavior you want, wrap it, or extract it into a `preset`, which can be shared across multiple projects.

## Inspired projects

This project was inspired by `tailwindcss`, `sass`, `postcss`, `daisyui`, `antd`, `vant` and many more.

Now let's get started!
