# Build a component library from scratch

It is very simple to use `IceStack` to build a component library. As long as you see good-looking styles on various websites, you can write them into your CSS components.

For example, you can find many ready-made components in the [awesome-tailwindcss](https://github.com/aniftyco/awesome-tailwindcss) project.

Only a few changes are needed to turn it into our own component. Instead of loading the default set of components of `@icestack/preset-default`, you only need to set `mode` to `none`.

Let's get started right away!
